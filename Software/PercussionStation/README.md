# Note
The PercussionStation firmare must run the NewPing library from a Teensy 4.1- therefore it is required that the stock NewPing library is removed from the project and replaced with the [Teensy 4.x compatible NewPing library]https://github.com/mjs513/NewPing_t4).

## Instructions
To do this, follow these [instructions to delete the other NewPing](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016077340-How-do-I-delete-or-uninstall-a-library-from-the-IDE-) if needed.

and then download the NewPing_t4 library above and follow these [instructions to manually install a library](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library/all#manually-installing-a-library---windows)
